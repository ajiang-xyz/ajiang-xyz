# Hi 👋, I'm Alex

✏ I'm currently writing my own text editor in node, html, and css (without abusing a deprecated yet still unremoved html attribute: content-editable). The code is currently private as I want the repo to contain working, non-prototypical code. 

I've halted progress on my [Pixel Value Differencing steganography project](https://github.com/ajiang-xyz/PVD-Steganography), but I may pick it back up in the near future.

❔ Currently interested in cybersecurity, neuroscience, finance, and psychology
